        My participation in the Fab Lab is one of the achievements I am truly proud of from my high school years. Being part of the Fab Lab management team was not only an honor but also an experience that shaped me into the person I am today. Through the Fab Lab, I learned to operate various types of machinery from teachers, peers, and online resources, and I was always eager to share that knowledge by teaching my juniors.

        I was among the students who excelled in handling most of the Fab Lab equipment. Over time, I completed several projects using its machinesâ€”one of them was creating an Eiffel Tower model for my mathematics project on integral calculus, using laser cutting technology. I also contributed to the crawler drone project through 3D printing and Shop-Bot circuit board fabrication. Beyond that, I helped redesign the Fab Lab space, applying my skills in 3D design, and explored other creative processes such as t-shirt designing and sticker printing.
