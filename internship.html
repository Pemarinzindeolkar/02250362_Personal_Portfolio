      Back in high school, I was part of the Space and Technology Internship Program for two years. Through this program, we learned various extracurricular skills such as telescope handling, using Fab Lab technologies and machinery, and exploring ideas related to space. We often organized stargazing events where we set up telescopes for other students to observe the night sky. After learning from our seniors, we also taught younger students how telescopes work and the mechanisms behind them. As we progressed, we continued this tradition passing down the skills and knowledge we had gained to new members of the program, just as our seniors had done for us.
