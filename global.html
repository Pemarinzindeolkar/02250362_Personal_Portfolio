        The FIRST Global Competition was something entirely new to me, I had never heard of it before, even though I was always deeply involved in extracurricular activities. It was my first time learning about such an international event, and I was truly honored to be part of the non-traveling team, supporting the main team that represented Bhutan in Singapore.

        Within the team, we were divided into several groups, such as construction, multimedia, and programming. I was a member of the programming group, where I contributed my skills and knowledge to help our team grow and improve. Even though I wasn’t among those who travelled, I felt proud knowing that my efforts played a small part in something much bigger—helping my friends represent Bhutan on a global stage.
